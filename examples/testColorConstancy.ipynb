    "\n",
    "The upside of such approach is that, since pre-trained networks are learned on a large set of images, the intermediate layers capture the \"semantics\" of the general visual appearance. Think of it as a very powerful feature that you can treat as a black box. On top of that, only a few layers will be needed to obtain a very good performance of the data."
